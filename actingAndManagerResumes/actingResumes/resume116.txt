I strategize set plays and talk with each team member about how they can improve their skills and their fitness level. During pre-season training, I lead group workouts incorporating aerobic and anaerobic exercises, particularly HIIT & HIFT Training, as this training generates the best results with this type of high intensity sport. I work with my team to evaluate their current fitness levels, set goals, monitor progress and blast through plateaus.Acting TeacherNational Theatre School-2013 to 2015Melbourne\xa0I taught weekly Acting Masterclasses to adults ranging from 18-65 years old. The classes were streamed  for a range of abilities - from the novice to the more experienced. Each class held 15 students at a time, keeping it quite personal and in depth for a typical acting class. I focused on basic components such as active listening, giving, receiving offers, to more in depth exercises such as complete script deconstruction and character building techniques. For the more novice actor, it was important to give them a solid foundation before jumping into anything more complicated until they were ready to tackle it.Youth Sports CoachWesley College-2008 to 2008Melbourne\xa0As a Wesley College Youth Football Coach, I was responsible in taking midweek trainings with grade 7 and 8 football players. I was able to easily adapt to the youth demographic, incorporating skill and low impact cardio based exercises applicable to their age and ability.EducationBACHELORDRAMATIC ARTS - NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DRAMATIC ARTS (NIDA)2018BACHELOR OF ARTS in MUSIC THEATREARTS ACADEMY2012Personal Training CourseInfofit EducatorsCertifications/LicensesACE Certified Personal TrainerCPR/AEDAdditional InformationSkills\xa0➔  1-on-1 Personal Training\xa0➔  Client Goal-Setting & Motivation\xa0➔  Customized Exercise\xa0➔  Strength & Conditioning\xa0➔  Cardiovascular / Endurance Training\xa0➔ HIIT & HIFT/Bootcamp-Style Workouts
