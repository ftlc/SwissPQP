My degree is in Agriculture Business and I enrolled in additional business classes such as Business Law, Accounting one and two, and both Micro and Macro Economics.  I have enclosed my resume for review.\xa0\xa0I am a big believer in there is no substitute for hands on experience, and with that in mind I have spent the last seventeen years taking advantage of working for, and with a variety of people associated with the agriculture industry.  Besides growing up on a farm, ranch and stocker operation, I have worked with farmers, ranchers, managers, veterinarians, cowboys, truck drivers and farm hands.  Most of my experience is in livestock, from cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, and goats.  This experience comes from showing, health care, brokering and production of these animals.  My farming experience is with wheat, milo and different varieties of hay, both forage and cash crop production. I have also spent a summer working to help build a successful Texas certified farmers market, including a branded beef program.   My experience derives from both working for people in the industry and being self employed in agriculture. I have attended additional educational workshops and schools such as Bovine Elite Reproduction School, Texas Agriculture Extensionâ€™s Master Marketer program, and West Texas Real Estate School. I have also helped develop a cattle breeding stock marketing company,  that markets cattle online and has a annual sale every year at the Lubbock Stockyards called Red Dirt Cattle and Exchange. Reddirtcattleexchange.com I have also helped in the development of a successful Branded Beef business called Diamond C Meat Co, that is a family venture.  \xa0\xa0People have always described me as a strong, humorous, and good personality orientated person.  I have always enjoyed talking with people and having new experiences. I have no problem with extensive travel.  I worked in customer service when I worked at Lubbock Stockyards, and I really enjoyed that experience, getting to deal with people and helping them solve their problems.  Although it was not always easy, it was however a good experience that I was able to carry over into every decision that I make today. \xa0\xa0I welcome the opportunity to meet with you at your  convinces and discuss the possibilities of what we may offer each other.  I want to take the time to thank you for your time and consideration.  Once again thank you.\xa0\xa0Sincerely,\xa0\xa0Casey Collins']
