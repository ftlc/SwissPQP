['MANAGERMANAGER-Work ExperienceMANAGERNORTHSTAR GAS BAR-August 2016 to June 2017It was run by myself and my brother for a year. On June 18th, at around 8:30 PM, there was a structural fire that occurred in the security room and destroyed the whole building itself. We have been closed since then and have been moving forward by working on city permits, obtaining quotes from different contractors, dealing with company representatives, and several government officials. I did run the business alone all of the time. My brother and I would take turns running the store while the other was out running errands and picking up shipments, which contain chocolates to candies, to tobacco products. I had authorization to write off checks to petrol deliveries, order petrol on certain days when we needed to, make different brand deals if the opportunity came up, deal with tobacco company representatives, including Imperial Tobacco Canada, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges (RBH), Wholesale Club, and many more. I was expected to, organize cigarette racks, know all of the brands we carried, and memorize the pricing of all the products within the business.\xa0ROFFER ASSISTANT, TR STAR ROOFING\xa0July 12th - July 21st\xa0Worked on several roofing sites from residential and commercial for 7 days.
