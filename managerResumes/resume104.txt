As a manager, I\'m used to working long hours and working for several weeks at a time with no day off. I have the, "Do whatever it takes", mentality. I\'d always arrive early to plan for the day ahead. When I wasn\'t selling, I would spend my time doing inventory and ordering. I spent several hours every day handling administrative work such as filing, bookkeeping and bill paying. I would frequently coordinate public events with local businesses and almost always work the event as well. I have great customer service and employee management skills and would thrive in either position. I have an immaculate customer service history, with zero complaints.\xa0Responsibilities:\xa0• Sales\xa0• Marketing (internet, radio, print)\xa0• Inventory and Ordering\xa0• Coordinate Events on and off-site\xa0• Employee Performance Reviews\xa0• Merchandising\xa0• Administrative (deposits, bills, payroll, filing)\xa0• Oversee Employees\xa0• Customer Service\xa0• Client Consultations\xa0• Co-Promote with other local businessesEducationGavilan College2006 to 2007Monte Vista Christian School2005Certificate in Jordan MalonePolice Academy']
