Movie Theater Crew memeberFlorida-Work ExperienceMovie Theater Crew memeberCobb theatre-April 2017 to PresentWhen I first started at Cobb Theatre, I started off in concession selling customers popcorn and drinks while handling their money. A couple weeks later I was put on the greeter stand directing our customers to their theatres. Iï¿½ve been an usher cleaning up after the movie and getting it ready for the next. After a few months of working there, I was put in box office handling ticket sales. I also have experience in customer service and serving visitors at our bar.EducationHigh school or equivalentSkillsMicrosoft word, photoshop (1 year)Certifications/LicensesServSafeMarch 2018 to March 2020Accuired through Cobb theatre
