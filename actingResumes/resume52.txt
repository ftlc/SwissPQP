Our responsibilities were to be on time, be prepared, come with ideas and be in uniform. In this program we would go to different baseball games and sometimes read articles and books about it. When we did attend to baseball games we had to be energetic and open minded. Our tasks was to take pictures, interview people, and write down notes which we would later on discuss. When interviewing people you would need patience, personality, and good questions. When we were not out at a baseball game, we would be in our work space discussing different topics not only just baseball but things that are going on in the world or different types of sports. We would also edit our videos that were made during the baseball games. Working as a journalist was a learning experience.ActingAfter School Matters-February 2017 to May 2017DancerAfter School Matters-June 2016 to August 2016EducationN/ADyett High SchoolAdditional InformationI am a hard working young woman.
