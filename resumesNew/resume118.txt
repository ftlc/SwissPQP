['Microwave Lab Volunteer ResearcherPlano, TX-Willing to relocate: AnywhereWork ExperienceMicrowave Lab Volunteer ResearcherTexas Tech University - Lubbock, TX-May 2017 to August 2017Updated LabVIEW programs to control near-field planar and cylindrical scanners used for antenna measurements and microwave imaging research. Updated the scanners’ motion control using USB motor controller, and updated microwave network analyzer data acquisition using a USB-GPIB (IEEE488) instrument controller.\xa0\xa0Set up a MakerGear M2 Dual 3D printer and used it to print 3D printed antennas using polylactic acid (PLA) filaments (to be electroplated). Used AutoDesk Inventor to draw the designs and Simplify3D as the slicing software.AIAA RAD ProjectBuilt an RF controller and receiver pair for use in RC vehicles such as an RC car or plane.\xa0\xa0Utilized two Arduino Nanos to control the motors (Brushless and Servo) from a distance of up to 20 meters away.\xa0\xa0Coded both the receiver and transmitter in Arduino language and wired the circuitry on a breadboard to later be soldered.Movie Theater Ticket Reservation System (Java)Utilized a login system, allowing multiple users to add to or update their orders. Also allowed for administrator capabilities.\xa0\xa0Handled large amounts of data at one time through use of advanced data structures.Arcade Database (C++)Utilized object-oriented thinking to provide a simple interface in which various commands to manipulate the database could be entered.\xa0\xa0Created an easy to maintain structure for continued use.EducationBachelor of Science in Computer EngineeringUniversity of Texas at Dallas - Richardson, TXAugust 2015 to PresentCoronado High School - Lubbock, TXAugust 2011 to May 2015SkillsMATLAB (1 year), Microsoft Office (4 years), Verilog (2 years), Xilinx (2 years), C (1 year), C++ (2 years), Java (2 years)']
